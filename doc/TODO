Things TO DO

* generate documentation from source -> bashdoc?

* export functions
    export -f functionname
  or
    set -a at the beginning, and set +a at the end?
  or
    create a new setting for nb that will control that behaviour

* populate nb-term
  - color names
  - term commands

* make a nb-debug module with functions like:
  - debug-info(), debug-warn(), debug-error() and control behaviour with a
    global variable of "debug level"
  - is there a log4sh? is it worth the trouble?

* make the net-hosts-{update,delete} scripts

* dynamically created functions. Use eval for that.

related to:
* remove configuration variable testing from the functions, instead 
  construct the functions dynamically with or without the feature, as needed.
