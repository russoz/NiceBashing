Changelog

Version 0.[789]
  * Moved many expressions to use of the constructs ${p#pattern} and ${p%pattern}
  * Moved core to nbcore to simplify the rsync command lines
  * load
    * Improved bash detection
    * Suppressing history entries for NB load process
    * Created nb_vecho which will check verbosity and if running in a terminal
  * sbin/nb-setup
    * Huge refactor, featuring a complete break-up of the many different actions,
      namely:
      * sbin/copy-nb
      * sbin/configure-load
      * sbin/configure-profile
    * Created a new sbin/install-nb that calls the steps above, in that order
    * Remote installation logic (from <here> to <host>:<there>) now consists of:
      1. copy-nb <here> <host>:<temp>
      2. ssh <host> <temp>/sbin/install-nb <there>
  * Created nbcore/nb-peers
    * New in NB, a system of replication for NB
    * Two functions:
      * nb-add-host <host>
        Adds a host to our list of peers, which will have NB kept in sync
      * nb-sync-host (-a|<hostname>)
        Where -a stands for "all" servers in the list, or you can specify
  * base/nb-term
    * Got term-set-title right this time

Version 0.6

  * Added remote installation to nb-setup
  * load:
    * Moved the bash checking code from nb-bash to load. It is the first thing
      done now. If not running bash, nothing else will be run.
    * Since it's assured to be runnning under bash now, added 'local'
      declarations to variables within functions. Removed subshell'ed functions,
      that were created to avoid leaving junk variables after invocation.
    * Simplified nb_set and nb_get
    * Rewrote nb_load_settings loop
    * Moved configuration reading closer to the beginning of the file, it is
      considered a critical part of the NB loading process
    * Renamed nb_load to nb_load_module, for clarity
    * Aesthetic changes galore
  * nb-setup
    * Now support options (getopts)
    * Usage message
    * Supports remote installation through rsync/ssh
